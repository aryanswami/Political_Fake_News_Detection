# Political_Fake_News_Detection
Created a Political Fake news detection system using Fact-checking and Bias detection.

This project investigates the proposal of a fake news detection system utilizing machine and deep learning approaches. 

The proposed model has two distinct characteristics: 
(i) it uses Headline Attention mechanism for detecting political bias in news articles using bidirectional LSTM model which computes attention weights for each word in the news headline.
(ii) it utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) frameworks to automate fact-checking process. 

As the required datasets were not available, I created a dataset comprising of 520 political news article headlines collected from various Indian as well as international news sources. The experiments conducted on the custom created datasets clearly demonstrated that the model presented is efficient and outperforms various baseline methods with an accuracy of 95.25%.
